Recently, quantum computing has drawn the attention of many companies around the world. This article aims to present an overview of quantum existing patents.

## Methodology
The following analysis is based on the extraction of the [WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html) (World Intellectual Property Organization). The analysis is focused on **patent families** which regroups patents covering the same technical content. The study is restricted to patents committed under classfication G06N 10/00 named "Quantum computing, i.e. information processing based on quantum-mechanical phenomena". The full IPC (International Patent Classification) can be found [here](https://ipcpub.wipo.int/). \
The WIPO offers a web interface to perform advanced patent search and extract the research output into a csv file (with a limitation of 10,000 lines). The reader can carry out his own research on WIPO's [patentscope tool](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/search.jsf). The source code and sample of data used for this study can be found on [github](https://github.com/v-gilbert/quantum_patent_analysis). \
The data extraction was done on 04/2022.

## Global numbers

The extraction of patents classified under G06N 10/00 IPC has provided 2 700 different and unique family of patents. The figure below shows the number of quantum patent families published the last 20 years using a logarithmic scale. Since 2015, the number of families nearly follows an exponential law, passing from about 10 patents per year in quantum computing field to more than 1000.

With 10 companies in the top 15 first publishers in quantum field, the United States of America is currently way beyond all other countries for the deposit of patents on this technology.
