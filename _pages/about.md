Hi, my name is Valentin Gilbert, I'm a independent quantum consultant at <a href="https://www.qounselor.fr/" target="_blank">Qounselor</a>. If you are a business interested in quantum technologies and do not know where to start, feel free to get in touch. 

Before getting deep on quantum technologies I got an engineering degree at the <a href="https://www.utt.fr/" target="_blank">University of Technology of Troyes</a> and several years of data engineer work experience. 

I validated my Ph.D. in quantum computing in early 2025 with the <a href="https://list.cea.fr/fr/" target="_blank">CEA-List</a> and <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/" target="_blank">University Paris-Saclay</a>, with a deep focus on quantum computer performance assessment and approximation of solutions to optimization problems using quantum and hybrid solutions.

## Area of Expertise
  * Quantum computer performance benchmark
  * Application use cases and design of Proof of Concept
  * Hybrid algorithms for optimization problems
  * Quantum Error Correction

## Last Contributions in Quantum Computing
  * (04/2025) Creation and launch of the <a href="https://quantumbenchmarkzoo.org/" target="_blank">Quantum Benchmark Zoo</a> 
  * (01/2025) Doctoral Thesis publication
  * (07/2024) Performance comparison between quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers at solving optimization problems.
